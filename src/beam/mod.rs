//! Code to abstract beam calculations.
//!
//! [Beam] is a trait detailing how to perform various beam-related tasks. By
//! making this trait, we can neatly abstract over multiple beam codes,
//! including a simple [NoBeam] type (which just returns identity matrices).
//!
//! Note that (where applicable) `norm_to_zenith` is always true; the
//! implication being that a sky-model source's brightness is always assumed to
//! be correct when at zenith.
