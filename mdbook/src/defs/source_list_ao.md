# The Andr√© Offringa (`ao`) source list format

This format is used by `calibrate` within `mwa-reduce` (closed-source code).

RA is in decimal hours (0 to 24) and Dec is in degrees in the J2000 epoch, but
sexagesimal formatted. All frequencies and flux densities have their units
annotated (although these appear to only be MHz and Jy, respectively).

Point and Gaussian components are supported, but not shapelets. All Gaussian
sizes are in arcsec, but their position angles are in degrees. In an image space
where RA increases from right to left (i.e. bigger RA values are on the left),
position angles rotate counter clockwise. A
position angle of 0 has the major axis aligned with the declination axis.

Flux densities must be specified in the power law or "list" style (i.e. curved
power laws are not supported).

Source names are allowed to have spaces inside them, because the names are
surrounded by quotes. This is fine for reading, but when converting one of these
sources to another format, the spaces need to be translated to underscores.
