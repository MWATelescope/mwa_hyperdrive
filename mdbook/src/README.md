`mwa_hyperdrive` (simply referred to as `hyperdrive`) is calibration software
for the Murchison Widefield Array radio telescope. The documentation contained
in this book aims to help understand how to use it and how it works.

Some of the more useful parts of this documentation might be:

- an [installation guide](installation/intro.md);

- a [user guide](user/intro.md); e.g.
  - [How do I use the program?](user/help.md)
  - [What does DI calibration do?](user/di_cal/intro.md)
  - [How do I get started with DI calibration?](user/di_cal/tutorial.md)

- definitions and concepts; e.g.
  - [What are supported sky-model source list formats?](defs/source_lists.md)
  - [How are XX, XY, YX, YY defined?](defs/pols.md)
  - [What is a calibration timeblock?](defs/blocks.md)
