# Installation

The easiest way to get access to `hyperdrive` is to download a pre-compiled
binary from GitHub. Instructions are on [the next page](pre_compiled.md).

However, you may need to compile `hyperdrive` from source. If so, see the
instructions [here](from_source.md) (note that the code will likely run faster
if you compile it from source).

Finally, regardless of how you get the `hyperdrive` binary, follow the [post
installation](post.md) instructions.
