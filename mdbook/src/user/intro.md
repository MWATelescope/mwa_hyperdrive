# Introduction

`hyperdrive` aims to make users' lives as easy as possible. Commands should
_always_ have good quality help text, errors and output messages. However, users
may have questions that the `hyperdrive` binary itself cannot answer; that's
where this documentation comes in.

If ever you find `hyperdrive`'s help text lacking or this documentation doesn't
answer your question, feel free to file an
[issue](https://github.com/MWATelescope/mwa_hyperdrive/issues) (or even better,
file a [PR](https://github.com/MWATelescope/mwa_hyperdrive/pulls)!).
