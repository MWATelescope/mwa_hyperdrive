# Writing out calibrated data

`di-calibrate` does not write out calibrated data (visibilities); see
[`solutions-apply`](../solutions_apply/intro.md). You will need calibration
solutions, so refer to the previous pages on DI calibration to get those.

~~~admonish tip
Calibrated visibilities are written out in one of the [supported
formats](../../defs/vis_formats_write.md) and can be
[averaged](../../defs/vis_formats_write.md#visibility-averaging).
