"SDC3" refers to the [third SKA Science Data
Challenge](https://sdc3.skao.int/overview). Here, there are derivative data
products for testing.

sdc3_0000.uvfits is a single-channel file with data only for the first
cross-correlation baseline on the first timestep. It contains only a single
polarisation of data (XX).

sdc3_0000.ms is similar to the uvfits (single-channel, only the first
cross-correlation baseline, first timestep, XX), but it has had the
`PHASED_ARRAY` table trimmed to get the file size down.
